Task 3.3: CUDA Operations

We can do even better than parallelization if we have access to specialized hardware. 
This task asks you to build a GPU implementation of the backend operations. 
It will be hard to equal what PyTorch does, 
but if you are clever you can make these computations really fast (aim for 2x of task 3.1).


You will need to modify `tensor_functions.py` slightly in this assignment.

* Tests:

```
python run_tests.py
```

* Note:

Several of the tests for this assignment will only run if you are on a GPU machine and will not
run on github's test infrastructure. Please follow the instructions to setup up a colab machine
to run these tests.

This assignment requires the following files from the previous assignments. You can get these by running

```bash
python sync_previous_module.py previous-module-dir current-module-dir
```

The files that will be synced are:

        minitorch/tensor_data.py minitorch/tensor_functions.py minitorch/tensor_ops.py minitorch/operators.py minitorch/module.py minitorch/autodiff.py minitorch/module.py project/run_manual.py project/run_scalar.py project/run_tensor.py
